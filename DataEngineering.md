Synapse Data Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric is the first data warehouse that supports multi-table transactions and natively embraces an open data format. The warehouse is built on the robust SQL Server query optimizer and an enterprise grade distributed query processing engine that eliminates the need for configuration and management. Synapse Data Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric seamlessly integrates with Data Factory for data ingestion, Power BI for analysis and reporting, and Synapse Spark for data science and machine learning. It streamlines an organization's analytics investments by converging data lakes and warehouses.

Data warehousing workloads benefit from the rich capabilities of the SQL engine over an open data format, enabling customers to focus on analysis and reporting. They also benefit from accessing data from OneLake, a data lake storage virtualization service.

Synapse Data Warehouse is in public preview. To learn more, see the documentation and visit the announcement blog.
